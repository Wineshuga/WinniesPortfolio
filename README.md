<h1>Winnie's Portfolio</h1>
<p>This started out as a project given during Zuri/HNG Internship. It happened to be my very first attempt at building a website.
After several months, I am back to make some changes and turn it into a portfolio site.
Some unnecessary pages were taken out: a contact page, registration page and a login page. This is now a one page portfolio site</p>
