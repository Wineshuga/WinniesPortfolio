        <h4>Hello, There!!!</h4>
        <p>So because you clicked, I am delighted. The lady in the photo, that's me. I'm Nweneary Uzochukwu
            <strong>Winnie
            </strong>and this is my space. I am an SE student who has been learning to code since January 2022. I'm
            currently
            enrolled at the Ingressive for Good/Zuri programme learning Frontend web development part time and also
            take some
            other SE courses too.
        </p>
        <p>It is my desire to be in the tech community before the end of August. I'd like to be identified as
            'techy', lol.
            This is why I am putting in all that I have got now.</p>
        <p>Ok, let me not bore you with all these serious stuff; I am not half as serious as my intro might have
            painted
            me. You will find below some of the things I enjoy and some skills I have.</p>
